## Project

### A project for exploring Azure services by performing various labs

This project consists of a Blazor standalone application that connects to various services on Microsoft Azure and is hosted at Azure DevOps.

A second remote is on GitHub. It mirrors the Azure repo and serves as a backup in case the Azure repo needs to be abandoned due to financial or other reasons. The GitHub repo is public.
